Hello! My name is **Kristen**. :grinning:

<br>

I am a self-taught software developer.

I have varying levels of experience with Flutter / Dart, Go, Python, C++, HTML
and CSS. I excel at picking up new skills as they prove needful, be it a
programming language, framework, shell scripting, packaging, etc.

I am a great proponent of open source / libre projects and collaboration. I
think working together brings out the best of humanity.

I believe that **clean code** is good code, and that **good documentation** can be the glue
that makes or breaks a project.

<br>

I speak:

- English - _advanced fluency_
- German - _intermediate_
- French - _intermediate_
