Unit Bargain Hunter is a multi-platform application that allows the
user to compare multiple items when shopping by item count, volume, or weight
along with the price of each item in order to easily find which is the best
value and by how much.

Unit Bargain Hunter is a relatively straight-forward app with a light / dark
theme toggle and using `bloc` for state management.
