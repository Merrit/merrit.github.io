            <h2>Nyrna</h2>
            <p>Suspend games and applications.</p>
            <img src="https://nyrna.merritt.codes/assets/images/promo-e8afdfd466844e711c6d2117efa5c5c4.jpg" alt="Promo" />
            <p>
                Nyrna is a cross-platform desktop application written with Flutter that allows
                one to suspend and resume applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design has intentionally been kept simple and minimalist as this software is
                expected to be used by anyone, including those who are not 'tech-savvy'.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working with Flutter to create Nyrna has been excellent, as even while
                considered an alpha level feature the desktop software creation experience has
                been quite exceptional.
            </p>
            <p>
                On Linux the project is quite straight forward, making use of regular system
                calls to get process information, suspend, and resume.
            </p>
            <p>
                Windows on the other hand required a great deal more attention, as I have found
                throughout the project that the win32 API does not provide a meaningful
                interface with which to check the status of a process, nor to send a signal
                like one familiar with Linux might expect.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ended up writing several direct wrappers
                using <code>dart:ffi</code> - the dart Foreign Function Interface that facilitates C
                interop, in order to make calls to the win32 API directly from native Dart code, as well
                as <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/win32_suspend_process">creating a small library</a> specifically
                to handle the calls to <code>ntdll.dll</code> in order to use the
                undocumented <code>NtSuspendProcess()</code> and <code>NtResumeProcess()</code> functions.
            </p>
            <p>
                While not easy or straightforward, the challenge presented here was quite
                interesting and rewarding - and I enjoyed learning more about systems level
                programming and APIs.

            <h2>Unit Bargain Hunter</h2>
            <p>A quick and simple way to verify which is the best value when comparing what to shop for.</p>
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Merrit/unit_bargain_hunter/main/assets/images/promo/promo.png" alt="Showcase" />
            <p>
                Unit Bargain Hunter is a multi-platform application that allows the
                user to compare multiple items when shopping by item count, volume, or weight
                along with the price of each item in order to easily find which is the best
                value and by how much.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unit Bargain Hunter is a relatively straight-forward app with a light / dark
                theme toggle and using <code>bloc</code> for state management.
