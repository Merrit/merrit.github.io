Hi, my name is Kristen. ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught software developer and I have a great
passion for open source / libre projects. I have devoted countless hours towards
creating and improving projects to benefit everyone.

I truly hope that people will find my work to be useful! ðŸ˜ƒ

It takes a huge amount of time to develop open-source projects that are given
away for free, so any support of my past and future works is **greatly**
appreciated!
